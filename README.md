# weisimu

This package was prepared for STAT 900, and investigates the bias, variance, and MSE of the trimmed mean of data from a Weibull distribution.
The authors are Xiaoya Wang, Bertrand Sodjahin, and Gradon Nicholls.

We developed a basic shiny app to showcase our package; see here: https://gnicholl.shinyapps.io/weisimu2/
